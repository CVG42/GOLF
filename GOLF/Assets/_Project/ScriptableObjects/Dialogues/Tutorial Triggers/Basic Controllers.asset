    Line: "I took the liberty of placing the controls at the bottom of the screen\u2026
      you know, just in case your tiny attention span can\u2019t handle more."

    Line: "In the lower right corner, oh mighty chosen one, you\u2019ll see how to

    Line: "Ah, I almost forgot\u2026 in the lower left corner, you\u2019ll behold
      the world I\u2019ve built for you. Or in case your tiny brain forgot where
      you are."
