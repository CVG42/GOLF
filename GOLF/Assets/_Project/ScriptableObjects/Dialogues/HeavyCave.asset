  - Character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 7025ae23c62cf1d4783b7307e18aa6d9, type: 2}
    Line: Hello! Are you another one of the... uh... cats who stayed here?
  - Character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 13395de99bfa0ec4abf704516b7103cb, type: 2}
    Line: Mmm... technically, I'm in existential checkmate. But yes, you could say
      I gave up before the end. A miscalculation.
  - Character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 7025ae23c62cf1d4783b7307e18aa6d9, type: 2}
    Line: Oh... sorry. Did you play something before?
  - Character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 13395de99bfa0ec4abf704516b7103cb, type: 2}
    Line: I played and breathed chess. Until a mouse distracted me in the middle
      of a crucial game. I lost focus. I lost the queen.
  - Character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 7025ae23c62cf1d4783b7307e18aa6d9, type: 2}
    Line: Wow! But you're still here. Have you thought about trying again?
  - Character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 13395de99bfa0ec4abf704516b7103cb, type: 2}
    Line: Mmm... nah. Now I'm dedicated to philosophizing about the weight of things.
      Life.
  - Character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 7025ae23c62cf1d4783b7307e18aa6d9, type: 2}
    Line: Well, I'm right in the middle. I've already passed two camps... and although
      it's been difficult, I think I'm closer to returning to my human.
  - Character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 13395de99bfa0ec4abf704516b7103cb, type: 2}
    Line: With that spirit... you're going to go far, rookie. And speaking of weight...
      Maybe this will help.
  - Character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 13395de99bfa0ec4abf704516b7103cb, type: 2}
    Line: "Your ball is now heavier. More stable. Like me after five cans of pat\xE9."
  - Character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 7025ae23c62cf1d4783b7307e18aa6d9, type: 2}
    Line: Thanks! This is going to help me a lot.
  - Character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 13395de99bfa0ec4abf704516b7103cb, type: 2}
    Line: Don't forget one thing, kid... Not everything that weighs you down is a
      hindrance. Sometimes it's the weight itself that keeps you on the straight
      and narrow.
  - Character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 13395de99bfa0ec4abf704516b7103cb, type: 2}
    Line: And now if you don't mind, I have a nap pending with a first and last name.
  - Character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 7025ae23c62cf1d4783b7307e18aa6d9, type: 2}
    Line: I promise to put your power to good use... and maybe one day, I'll roll
      a strike for you.
